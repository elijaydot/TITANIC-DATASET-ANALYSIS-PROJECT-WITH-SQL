/*
Handling Missing Values for Age:
The methodology used is Imputation: 
The approach used here is to impute missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the age distribution. This ensures that we retain all records for analysis without significantly altering the overall distribution of ages. We can calculate the mean or median age and use that value to replace missing entries.
Using Median Age , the median age of passengers is 29.6991176470405

Handling Missing Values for Cabin:

/*
Handling Missing Values for Embarked:
